# url-shortifier
### a URL shortning service built on redis

This service enables you to transform big and ugly URLs to short URLs that can easily be shared and memorized. 

- Fast: runs on memort, no disk IOs. :rocket:
- Secure: all urls are checked for malicious content before they are shortened. :lock:
